1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?:
   Using appropriate testing methods will ensure that my work is functional and secure. In this project I learned how to impletment JUnit test. I leanred that I needed to use the right test for each method and variable. Taking the time to build a test suite with high coverage will ensure the code is functional and secure.

2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?:
   To incorporate user needs into a program you need to use your functional expertise to decipher what they truly want and what their business needs are. For example, a client may ask for the software to be usable on mobile devices. We can conduct further investigating with asking the right questions to get into the details for their needs. Clients will not have the technical skill or knowledge to express their needs without help from you.

3. How do I approach designing software?:
   When designing software I need to take into account client business needs, budget, and time. I need to be able to investigate what exactly the client wants and develop a plan based around their time constraints and budget.
